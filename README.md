# Planet Generator

[HTML5 demo](https://jpbotelho.github.io/planetgen/)
# How it works

	- Pick a value X
	- Generate 200-1000 points inside a sphere of diameter X
	- Create a convex mesh with the above generated points
	- Generate a perfect sphere of diameter X (you can make it a little lower or higher, that's the water level feature in the demo)
	- Color the perfect sphere blue, and overlap with the convex mesh
	- ???
	- Profit
